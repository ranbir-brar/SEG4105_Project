## Project Description
The Health Check-In App is a react-native mobile application which aims to provide users reminders and information on pre-operative and post-operative instructions for elective surgeries at CHEO and Stollery.

This project aims to develop an interactive mobile phone application to both provide timely reminders to caregivers and patients for reporting illness, appropriate fasting intervals and serve as accessible resource for providing patients with answers to common questions regarding preparation for surgery and postoperative recovery.
