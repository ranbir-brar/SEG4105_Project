## Meeting Minutes From Betting Table
- We decided to look at each pitch as a group staring with Yasser's Heath Checklist pitch.
  - *Does the problem matter?*
  - The problem matters because patients would like to document and keep track of different illnesses before their surgery
  - It's also important to have documented health checks before a patient's surgery in case of emergencies.
  - *Is the appetite right?*
  - The 6-week timeframe seems too little for such a complex feature
  - *Is the solution attractive?*
  - Yes. The Health Checklist has a user friendly interface, with a simple "yes" or "no" button selection.
  - *Is this the right time?*
  - Yes. From user feedback we have identified this feature's need, it benefit the users.
  - *Are the right people available?*
  - No. We would need confirmation from professionals regarding the proper health checks prior to a surgery.
- Next up we looked at Ranbir's Event Page pitch.
  - *Does the problem matter?*
  - Yes. Surgeries can be unique, a feature that allows customization would be helpful to the users.
  - *Is the appetite right?*
  - Again, the feature would require more than 6 weeks to effectively implement.
  - *Is the solution attractive?*
  - Yes. It offers users the ability to create reminders/events in a centralized location.
  - *Is this the right time?*
  - No. We believe that it isn't worth it to implement a feature for custom surgeries since it is quite a rare thing to happen, and the demand for it from users isn't high.
  - *Are the right people available*
  - No. We would need access to a large list of medical terms for the glossary that aren't available for us at this moment.
  - We would also need access to credible translation source to translate terms to French.
- Lastly, we looked at Jason's Health Check-In Map Pitch
  - *Does the problem matter?*
  - Yes. New patients would like to have a local, offline version of the hospital map. 
  - *Is the appetite right?*
  - Yes. 6 weeks seems like a feasible timeframe to integrate the map feature.
  - *Is the solution attractive?*
  - Yes. An easily accessible and zoomable map that functions offline can be extremely helpful for users.
  - *Is this the right time?*
  - Yes. After looking at user feedback, we identified this is a pain point for users, integrating the feature now would be beneficial
  - *Are the right people available*
  - Yes. There is already a map available in our assets for our use.
- After going through the "Questions To Ask" from the Shape Up Philosopy of the Betting Table, we decided to choose Jason's pitch of a Health Check-In Map feature since it aligns with the 6 week cycle and we have all available resoruces to implement it.
