# Shape Up Pitch: Health Checklist Feature for Capstone Project
## Contributor
- Yasser Alnader (Student #: 300072599)

## Problem
- Our Capstone project is dedicated to creating a comprehensive app for children undergoing surgery at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) and the Stollery Children's Hospital. This app serves as a vital resource for providing pre-operative and post-operative information, ensuring that young patients and their families receive the necessary support and guidance during a challenging time.
- In our initial pilot studies, we have identified a significant issue within the current app: there is no provision for users to maintain a health checklist. This missing feature poses a considerable inconvenience for our users as they are unable to keep track of essential health-related tasks and appointments. To address this issue, we propose the integration of a Health Checklist feature into our app for both CHEO and the Stollery Children's Hospital.

## Appetite
- Our objective, upon implementing this feature, is to enhance the user experience for children and their families when visiting CHEO and Stollery for elective surgeries. We aim to provide users with an easy-to-access and user-friendly Health Checklist feature, allowing them to efficiently manage their health-related tasks and appointments.
- We aim to complete the development of this feature within a single development cycle of 6 weeks, believing it to be a reasonable timeframe for successful implementation.

## Solution
- For the solution, we plan to integrate a comprehensive Health Checklist feature that encompasses the following key aspects:
- A user-friendly interface that allows easy access to the Health Checklist from the app's main menu.
- Users will be able to add and manage tasks related to their health, including medication schedules, appointment reminders, and post-operative care instructions.
- The checklist will allow users to mark tasks as completed and receive notifications for upcoming appointments or tasks.
- All data in the Health Checklist will be securely stored on the user's device, ensuring privacy and accessibility without requiring an internet connection.

## No-Gos
- To maintain a focused and successful implementation of this feature during the 6-week cycle, we will establish several key "no-gos":
- We will not introduce any additional features or functionalities unrelated to the Health Checklist during this development cycle. Our primary goal is the successful integration of this crucial feature.
- We will prioritize this project, ensuring that our team's efforts remain dedicated to this aspect and avoiding distractions from other projects.
- We will not compromise by implementing external third-party solutions for the Health Checklist, as it may impact our control over the feature's quality and adaptability to stakeholder feedback. We will build the feature from scratch.
- For this 6-week cycle, we will not extend the feature to include detailed information sections for different health conditions or treatments, as this may clutter the app. Such expansions may be considered in future development cycles.

## Rabbit Holes
- Although the Health Checklist feature appears straightforward to implement within the 6-week cycle, there are potential complexities and "rabbit holes" that we need to be cautious of:
- Our app currently supports English and French. Stakeholders have expressed interest in eventually adding support for Indigenous languages, but this will not be addressed in the current cycle. For now, we will focus on making the feature available in English and French.
- We recognize the importance of meeting accessibility requirements. During this cycle, we will prioritize implementing the core Health Checklist feature, including task management and notifications. We will conduct a thorough accessibility assessment in the future, ensuring compliance with requirements.

## Conclusion
- The Health Checklist feature is a critical addition to our Capstone app, aimed at improving the user experience for those visiting CHEO and the Stollery Children's Hospital. This feature will empower users to manage their health tasks and appointments effectively, reducing stress and uncertainty during their hospital visits. With a clear goal, defined boundaries, and a realistic timeline, the Health Checklist feature is ready for development.
